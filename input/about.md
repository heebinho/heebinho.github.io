## Why renatoheeb.com
Back in the year 2000 I wrote my first website and published my first thoughts on the web. I've come a long way since then. Used naughty languages to add some dynamic features, hosted different content management systems, used prebuilt blog engines and social media platforms. I've realized that simplicity and decentralization are key to an open, free and autonomous web and society.

## How
Currently I'm using a static site generator to render my site. Git and CI/CD pipelines ensure that publishing is as simple as possible, while I don't have to manage a database at all. 

## About me
I love football, squash and sports in general. I like to travel and to read a good book. My XSR 900 takes me to known and unknown places. Music is a valued companion. I cherish good food and appreciate an interesting conversation along with a craft beer.
