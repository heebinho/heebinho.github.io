The Honda CR-V is roomy and convenient and easy to drive. It rides nice and smoothing, without the jouncy harshness of most SUVs. It's surprisingly maneuverable in tight quarters and handles well on winding roads. The CR-V with all-wheel-drive will let you explore australia beyond highways in an economic way.

Cruise Control and the automatic transmission are perfect features for a relaxing roadtrip and the sunroof is ideal for stargazing at night.

# Build
For my roadtrip I was looking for a reliable and economic car, with lots of space and all-wheel-drive, so that I would be able to go everywhere and to sleep in the car. After researching, the CR-V was the obvious choice for me.
The car was not prepared for a roadtrip and so I've built my own mini "Campervan" with simplicity in mind.

First of all I've removed the back seats, so that there is enough space for a bed. I kept the single back seat, which I use to hangout. (So the car has actually 3 seats, where one is unmounted).

The CR-V comes with a handy built-in camping table, which is part of the "floor". When I was thinking about how to build a platform for the bed, it was important to me, that the camping table will still be accessible and not blocked. When I looked at other builds, I didn't like, that they lifted their platform right under the rooftop. I decided to build the platform for the bed as low as possilbe to maximize the "living space" in the car. I bought a plywood platform, divided the platform in four main pieces and connected them with hinges, so that I'm able to collapse, lift and remove the platform easily. So it's possible to lift the rear part of the platform to access the camping table and the space underneath it. The front part of the platform is divided in two separate pieces, so that the driver seat and the "co-driver-seat" can be freed up individually. The platform is lifted only a couple of centimeters, so that an even surface results and that air can flow under the platform.
The front part of the platform is set upon to simple store boxes so that no space is wasted.
It's a very simple setup an should be easily extendable.

I decided to buy a real mattress instead of simple foam underlyings. So an <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/oemsint-pocket-spring-mattress-f-extend-bed-30348589/" target="_blank">IKEA Ömsint (91x190)</a> is used as the Bed. One mattress ‒ three lengths. With the help of the 2 extendable parts, the mattress can grow. 

Fresh air is important and after finding some big spiders in the car I've mounted two mosquito nets to safeguard.


## Power
To charge all my devices I bought a power inverter, which is placed in the cup holder beneath the driver seat and powered through the 12V adapter. The inverter has an australian standard power socket and two usb ports.
A second 12V adapter is in the rear part of the car and I used that adapter to charge an additional 10'000 mAh powerbank.
For me it was enough to power my notebook, my kindle, my gopro, my phone and my headphones.

## Sound
The car comes with a JVC stereo radio. Just pair your phone and startup spotify and you're ready to go. The JVC also features CD, Radio, USB, AUX and more.
When I hit the first gravel road the radio sacked down. I've fixed the installation but didn't fit the sourroundig silver stripes perfectly. It's a minor non-functional issue though.
